    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  we are GTSeries company in jerusalem/beit hanina "Nevi Yacoup" built almorshed app to support education progress, 
				  specially for students from grade6 - 12
				  
				  We are very concerned about the privacy of students and their parents as well as schools.
				  
				  Thus, Schools have their own database so that they have two options, 
				  the first is to have the server in the school or to be in the cloud, 
				  and the school has full access and control over it, 
				  so that the profiles of students and teachers are stored on the school server, 
				  as well as the messaging and Academic data, 
				  so that we, GTSeries, do not keep any information about students or teachers on company or third-party servers .
				  
                
                </p> <p><strong>Ads</strong></p> <p>
                 No advertisements are displayed in the basic services on the Al-Murshid application platform, 
				 and the student profile is not used in any way to build an advertising targeting mechanism at all.				
				

				</p> <p><strong>Paid app</strong></p> <p>
                  Al-Murshid application is a paid program in which the parent can purchase a copy of it. 
				  So that the student can communicate directly with his school and obtain electronic exams and other educational materials..
